# Ada C23 PSE 03 - Hamming Distance

*This PSE 03 "companion" repo was created to practice working with Git/GitHub,
as well as to practice a bit with setting up requirements and Pytest tests.*

### Problem Statement
Create a function named `hamming_distance` that calculates the number of
differences between two DNA strands.
  - Parameters: Two DNA strands of equal length (strand1 & strand2)
  - Function returns the number of differences between each strand

For example, given the following strands `hamming_distance` should return
`7`:

| **Example Input** | **Expected Output** |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `strand1 = "GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT"`<br>`strand2 = "CATCGTAATGACGGCCT"` | 7 |
